**Phase:** 1 — Data layer (bd epic: `dp-2ri`)
**Last updated:** 2026-07-16

## Done (with verification evidence)
- Epic expanded into `dp-2ri.1`–`dp-2ri.7` with dependencies wired (`bd show dp-2ri`)
- `dp-2ri.1` Domain model — analyze clean, 2 tests pass; committed a9d983f
- `dp-2ri.2` Drift database — build_runner clean, analyze clean, tests pass,
  `flutter build web --release` exits 0 with sqlite3.wasm + drift_worker.js in build output;
  schema v1 baseline in `drift_schemas/drift_schema_v1.json`
- `dp-2ri.3` Repository layer — 12 tests green (CRUD, soft-delete, ranges, watch)
- `dp-2ri.4` Fixture generator — 7 tests green (determinism, Poisson rate, weights)
- `dp-2ri.5` Aggregations — 40 tests green total; hand-computed boundary cases caught the drift
  UTC-normalization bug (see gotchas), fixed with LocalDateTimeConverter

## In progress
- `dp-2ri.6` Web WASM smoke test + CI step — test written (`test/web/db_smoke_test.dart`,
  wasm loaded from asset bundle via rootBundle — fetching an unserved URL hangs the suite),
  CI step added to test.yml, `web/sqlite3.wasm` declared as pubspec asset. Local
  `--platform chrome` runs wedge on this machine (`dp-0ot`, see CLAUDE.md Test-run rules),
  so the gate is CI: push, then confirm the "Tests" workflow chrome step is green.

## Next steps
<!-- Executable by a fresh agent with ZERO conversation context. -->
1. Commit + push dp-2ri.6 work; `gh run watch` the Tests workflow; if the chrome step is green,
   `bd close dp-2ri.6`
2. Then `dp-2ri.7`: verify exit criteria with evidence, write `designs/PHASE_1_HANDOFF.md` from
   template, delete this file, `bd close dp-2ri.7 dp-2ri`, push.
   Full plan: `~/.claude/plans/lets-come-up-with-gentle-waffle.md`

## Known issues & gotchas
- `*.g.dart` is gitignored; CI runs build_runner before analyze/test, so generated code must never
  be committed
- **Drift text mode normalizes datetimes to UTC on write** — it does NOT keep local wall time.
  `occurredAt` therefore uses a custom `LocalDateTimeConverter` (TEXT column, local wall-time ISO,
  no zone suffix) in `lib/data/db/bowel_movements_table.dart` so `date(occurred_at)` groups by the
  user's calendar day. Sync timestamps (created/updated/deletedAt) stay drift-managed UTC text.
  Range queries must compare via `LocalDateTimeConverter().toSql(...)` strings.
- **drift and drift_dev are pinned to exactly 2.34.0** — drift_dev 2.34.0's schema tool breaks
  against drift 2.34.2, and drift_dev ≥2.34.1+1 needs analyzer ^13 which conflicts with
  riverpod_generator 4.x (analyzer ^12). Bump both together, in lockstep, when upgrading.
- `--base-href /DejaPoo/` gets mangled by Git Bash path conversion on Windows — run
  `flutter build web` from PowerShell (or `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`)

## Decisions made this phase
- 2026-07-16 — Datetimes stored as ISO-8601 text (`store_date_time_values_as_text: true`);
  occurredAt in local wall time for SQL day-grouping, sync timestamps in UTC
- 2026-07-16 — Domain entity bound to Drift via `@UseRowClass` (no duplicate mapping layer)
- 2026-07-16 — Streaks/gaps computed in Dart over SQL daily-count series
- 2026-07-16 — Riverpod upgraded to 3.x runtime / generator 4.x (needed for drift_dev analyzer
  compat); riverpod_lint + custom_lint dropped until ecosystem aligns (`dp-9w0`)
